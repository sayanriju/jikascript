# JikaScript

JikaScript is a lightweight ECMAScript-inspired language for embedded development.
Source files (`.jika`) are compiled by a Go-based compiler into readable C99, then
built with target-native tooling.

  CLI: `npx skills add sayanriju/jikascript --skill jikascript`
  (add `-g` for a global install). Local fallback: `mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills && ln -s \"$PWD/skills/jikascript\" ~/.agents/skills/jikascript`

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+
- C compiler for host-side runtime checks (`gcc` or compatible)

For CH32V003 firmware builds:
- [PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/) (`pio` on `PATH`)

PlatformIO downloads the CH32V platform, the `ch32v003fun` framework, and the
RISC-V toolchain on first build, so no separate CH32fun checkout or toolchain
install is required.

## Building the CLI

Build the project-local binary into the repo's `bin/` directory:

```bash
go build -o bin/jikascript ./cmd/jikascript
```

Then run it explicitly from the repo root:

```bash
./bin/jikascript version
```

## Optional: justfile helpers

If you use [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just), the repo includes a small [justfile](justfile) with setup, cleanup, and hardware-recovery helpers:

```bash
just help
just bin
just install
just clean
just erase
just unbrick
```

The CLI itself is the canonical workflow for checking, transpiling, building, and flashing firmware. The just helpers intentionally avoid re-wrapping those commands so the defaults stay unambiguous and the main interface remains the `jikascript` binary.

## CLI usage

```text
jikascript check <input.jika>
jikascript version
jikascript transpile <input.jika> [--output=<file.c>] [--target=ch32v003]
jikascript build <input.jika|input.c> [--output=<prefix>] [--board=<board>] [--env=<env>] [--optimize=size|speed]
jikascript flash <input.jika|input.c> [--output=<prefix>] [--board=<board>] [--env=<env>] [--port=<device>] [--optimize=size|speed]
```

`--optimize` is optional. When omitted, the PlatformIO platform default is used
unchanged. Pass `--optimize=size` for `-Os` or `--optimize=speed` for `-O2`.

### check

Validate syntax and semantics (no C generation):

```bash
jikascript check examples/blink.jika
```

### version

Print the compiler and language specification versions:

```bash
jikascript version
```

The current release is `0.3.4`, targeting language specification `0.2.0`.

The `v0.1` labels throughout this README refer to the implementation milestone
and feature set described in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md); they do not indicate the
compiler release version.

### transpile

Generate readable C99:

```bash
jikascript transpile examples/blink.jika --output=out/blink.c
```

For a beginner-friendly workflow, this is the recommended path:

```bash
jikascript transpile examples/blink.jika --output=out/blink.c
# inspect and edit out/blink.c as needed
jikascript build out/blink.c --board=ch32v003 --optimize=size
```

This keeps the generated C readable and reviewable, and lets you make a final hand-tuned edit before building firmware. For quick iterations, `jikascript build examples/blink.jika ...` still works as a direct source build.

### build (CH32V003 via PlatformIO)

`build` accepts either a `.jika` source file or a generated readable `.c` file.
This lets you review or hand-edit the transpiled C before building firmware.

```bash
jikascript build examples/blink.jika
```

The command generates a PlatformIO project under `out/<name>-pio/`, runs
`pio run` for the selected environment, and copies the resulting firmware to
`build/<name>.elf` and `build/<name>.bin`.

PlatformIO must be installed and on `PATH`. If it is missing, the build fails
immediately with an actionable message:

```text
PlatformIO (pio) not found on PATH; install it with `pip install platformio` ...
```

Editable generated-C workflow (recommended for review/edit before flashing):

```bash
jikascript transpile examples/blink.jika --output=out/blink.c
# inspect and hand-edit out/blink.c
jikascript build out/blink.c
```

Optional custom artifact prefix:

```bash
jikascript build examples/blink.jika --output=dist/blink.elf
```

#### Board and environment selection

`--board` selects the CH32V003 package variant. Accepted values:

| Selector | PlatformIO board |
| --- | --- |
| `ch32v003` (default) | `genericCH32V003F4P6` |
| `genericCH32V003F4P6` | `genericCH32V003F4P6` |
| `genericCH32V003F4U6` | `genericCH32V003F4U6` |
| `genericCH32V003A4M6` | `genericCH32V003A4M6` |
| `genericCH32V003J4M6` | `genericCH32V003J4M6` |
| `ch32v003f4p6_evt_r0` | `ch32v003f4p6_evt_r0` |

```bash
jikascript build examples/blink.jika --board=genericCH32V003J4M6
```

`--env` overrides the PlatformIO environment name (default `ch32v003`). It is
useful when you want to keep several build configurations side by side.

### flash (CH32V003 via PlatformIO)

`flash` builds the firmware and uploads it with `pio run -t upload`:

```bash
jikascript flash examples/blink.jika
```

Pass `--port` to select a specific programmer or serial device:

```bash
jikascript flash examples/blink.jika --port=/dev/ttyUSB0
```

`flash` accepts the same `--board`, `--env`, and `--optimize` flags as `build`.

`pio run -t upload` is the source of truth for flash success. After a successful
upload, JikaScript copies any available PlatformIO artifacts (`firmware.elf`,
`firmware.bin`) into the requested output location. Missing post-upload
artifacts are treated as non-fatal; in particular, a missing `.bin` does not
fail `flash`.

### Optimization

`--optimize` is optional and defaults to leaving the PlatformIO platform
default untouched:

| Flag | Compiler flags | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *(omitted)* | platform default | No `build_flags` emitted |
| `--optimize=size` | `-Os` | Smallest firmware |
| `--optimize=speed` | `-O2` | Faster code, slightly larger |

Because PlatformIO appends its own default `-Os` after `build_flags`, selecting
`speed` also emits `build_unflags = -Os` so the requested mode actually takes
effect.

### PlatformIO executable

JikaScript runs `pio` from `PATH`. To use a different binary, set
`JIKASCRIPT_PIO`:

```bash
export JIKASCRIPT_PIO=/path/to/pio
```

Artifacts:

- `out/<name>.c` (generated source, when you run `transpile`)
- `out/<name>-pio/` (generated PlatformIO project, including `.pio/build/<env>/`)
- `build/<name>.elf`
- `build/<name>.bin`

## Examples

- [blink.jika](examples/blink.jika)
- [multiple_tasks.jika](examples/multiple_tasks.jika)
- [conditional_task.jika](examples/conditional_task.jika)
- [multi-file/app.jika](examples/multi-file/app.jika)

## Multi-file programs (v0.1)

Programs may be split across multiple `.jika` files with the compile-time
`include` statement:

```javascript
include "helpers.jika";
```

Included files' top-level statements are spliced into the program before
checking and code generation, so the result is one flattened program. Paths are
resolved relative to the including file, included files must end in `.jika`,
`include` is top-level only, and circular includes are rejected. See
[SPEC.md](SPEC.md) §4.3 and `docs/language/includes.md` for details.

## Bounded arrays (v0.1)

JikaScript supports bounded, homogeneous arrays with static capacity and mutable logical length.

```javascript
let readings: int32[8] = [21, 23, 25];
readings.push(27);
const latest = readings.pop();
const count = readings.length;
readings[0] = latest;
```

`push()` is capacity-checked and `pop()`/index operations are bounds-checked in generated C.
In v0.1, array declarations are top-level only and array-literal reassignment is rejected.

## Static objects (v0.1)

Object literals are statically shaped records, not dynamic JavaScript objects.
Property names and inferred property types are checked at compile time; property access
compiles to direct C struct access with no heap allocation or runtime lookup.

```javascript
const device = { name: "sensor-1", pin: 3, enabled: true };
device.pin = 4;       // allowed: `const` freezes the binding, not its contents
```

Unknown properties, duplicate property names, and incompatible property assignments are
compile-time errors. Functions may accept and return inferred object records when their
object arguments and returned object literals are statically resolvable.

## Equality semantics (v0.1)

- `==` and `===` are strict, non-coercing equality for supported types.
- `!=` and `!==` are strict inequality.
- Mixed-type equality comparisons (for example `number` vs `string`) are compile-time errors.

## Scalar and function typing (v0.1)

Declarations without annotations are inferred and emitted with matching C types:

| Inferred JikaScript type | Generated C type |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| string                   | `const char *`   |
| boolean                  | `bool`           |
| integer literal          | `int32_t`        |
| float literal            | `float`          |

Explicit annotations (`int8`, `uint8`, `int16`, `uint16`, `int32`, `uint32`,
`float32`, `boolean`, `string`) retain their mapped C types.

Top-level functions are precollected before bodies are checked, so calls may
appear before declarations. Parameter types are inferred from all call sites
(incompatible call-site types are rejected), and the return type is inferred
from all return expressions, including returns inside `if`, loops, blocks, and
switch cases. Mixed bare/value returns and incompatible value returns are
compile-time errors. A function whose parameter or return type cannot be
resolved is rejected rather than silently emitted as `int`. Generated C uses
matching parameter and return types.

## Scheduler capacity (v0.1)

The portable scheduler's task capacity is a build-time macro in
`runtime/periodic/periodic.h`:

```c
#ifndef PERIODIC_MAX_TASKS
#define PERIODIC_MAX_TASKS 8U
#endif
```

Override it at build time, for example:

```bash
gcc -DPERIODIC_MAX_TASKS=16 ...
```

Generated JikaScript C wraps every `periodic_task_add()` call so a failed
registration (invalid interval, duplicate task, or full capacity) enters a
shared non-returning `jikascript_fail()` helper instead of silently dropping
the task.

## CH32fun timer adapter (target-only)

The target build includes a timer adapter under `targets/ch32fun/runtime/`
exposing exactly one initializer:

```c
void periodic_ch32fun_init(void);
```

The adapter configures a hardware timer interrupt at 1 ms; the ISR calls only
`periodic_tick_ms(1U)`. Application callbacks are never executed from
interrupt context — generated startup calls, in order:

```c
periodic_init();
periodic_ch32fun_init();
```

## Validation status labels

- **Host-tested**: verified with the Go test suite and host C99 compilation
  (`go test ./...` plus the portable scheduler test below). All features
  documented above are host-tested.
- **Target-compiled**: verified by compiling firmware through PlatformIO
  against the `ch32v003fun` framework. `jikascript build` produces a linked
  `.elf` and `.bin` for CH32V003. Not yet claimed for any feature.
- **Hardware-verified**: verified by flashing a physical CH32V003 board and
  observing behavior. Not yet claimed for any feature.

## Validation commands

```bash
go test ./...
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra runtime/periodic/test_periodic.c runtime/periodic/periodic.c -I runtime/periodic -o /tmp/periodic_test && /tmp/periodic_test
# Capacity override check:
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -DPERIODIC_MAX_TASKS=2 runtime/periodic/test_periodic_capacity.c runtime/periodic/periodic.c -I runtime/periodic -o /tmp/periodic_cap && /tmp/periodic_cap
```

## Scheduler time source integration

The portable scheduler no longer advances time inside `periodic_run()`.
A platform timer (typically ISR-driven) must advance the scheduler clock via:

```c
periodic_tick_ms(elapsed_ms);
```

For interrupt/main-context synchronization, platforms may register critical-section hooks:

```c
periodic_set_critical_section(enter_fn, exit_fn);
```
