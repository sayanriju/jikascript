# JikaScript

JikaScript is a lightweight, JavaScript-inspired programming language for
microcontrollers and resource-constrained embedded systems. `.jika` source files
are compiled ahead of time by a Go toolchain into **readable pure C99**, which is
then built into firmware with the target's native toolchain (CH32V003 + CH32fun
via PlatformIO).

There is **no interpreter, VM, garbage collector, or language runtime** on the
MCU. The cooperative scheduler is a standalone pure-C library reused by the
compiler.

> Authoritative requirements live in `SPEC.md` in the jikascript repository.
> This skill is a practical reference for implementing `.jika` programs and using
> the CLI. When in doubt, follow SPEC.md semantics.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing `.jika` source files (variables, functions, arrays, objects, tasks).
- Explaining or implementing JikaScript language constructs and semantics.
- Building firmware: `jikascript build`, `transpile`, `check`, `flash`.
- Working with the cooperative periodic scheduler and task syntax.
- Using GPIO hardware abstration (`pin("PC1")`).
- Reviewing or hand-editing transpiled C before flashing.

## Quick Start

A complete minimal program — blink an LED every 1000 ms:

```javascript
// blink.jika
const led = pin("PC1");

led.output();

task("blink", 1000, () => {
    led.toggle();
});

scheduler.start();
```

Build and flash it:

```bash
jikascript check examples/blink.jika          # validate syntax + semantics
jikascript transpile examples/blink.jika --output=out/blink.c   # readable C
jikascript build examples/blink.jika          # -> build/blink.elf, build/blink.bin
jikascript flash examples/blink.jika --port=/dev/ttyUSB0
```

## Language at a Glance

```javascript
// Variables: const (immutable binding) and let (mutable)
const maxCount = 100;
let counter = 0;

// Explicit types map directly to C primitives
let reading: uint16 = 1024;
let voltage: float32 = 3.3;
let enabled: boolean = true;

// Functions (type-inferred from call sites and returns)
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Arrow functions (single-expression and block forms)
const square = x => x * x;
const toggle = () => { led.toggle(); };

// Control flow
if (reading > 100) { ... }
switch (state) { case 1: ...; break; default: ... }
while (running) { ... }
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) { ... }

// Bounded arrays: fixed capacity, mutable logical length
let readings: int32[8] = [21, 23, 25];
readings.push(27);
const latest = readings.pop();
const count = readings.length;

// Static object records -> C structs
const device = { name: "sensor-1", pin: 3, temperature: 24.5, enabled: true };

// File includes (compile-time textual splice)
include "helpers.jika";

// Cooperative periodic tasks
task("heartbeat", 500, () => { led.toggle(); });

// Start the scheduler
scheduler.start();
```

## Best Practice Notes

- Prefer `const` over `let`; the compiler enforces immutable bindings.
- Use explicit integer widths (`uint8`, `uint16`, `int32`, ...) near registers
  and memory-mapped data.
- `==` and `===` are both strict and non-coercing. Mixed-type comparisons are
  compile-time errors — never compare a `number` to a `string`.
- Reserve the words `task`, `scheduler`, `start`, `pin`, `include`, `HIGH`, and
  `LOW`: they are language syntax or fixed GPIO state constants, not ordinary
  identifiers.
- `HIGH` and `LOW` are predefined pin-state constants with fixed meanings
  `HIGH == 1` and `LOW == 0`; do not shadow or rebind them in user code.
- Array push/pop and index access are bounds- and capacity-checked at runtime;
  statically provable violations are rejected at compile time.
- The scheduler runs callbacks in main context; a long callback delays others.
- `include` is a compile-time textual splice, resolved relative to the including
  file, top-level only, and rejected on circularity.
