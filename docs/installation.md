# Installation

Getting started with JikaScript is simplest when you start from this repository,
then run the included examples and commands.

If you are brand-new to embedded development, the easiest path is:

1. clone/create a project from the JikaScript repo
2. install Go
3. install `just`
4. install PlatformIO
5. run your first `jikascript` command

---

## 1. Get the repository (recommended first step)

### Option A: shallow clone (fastest)

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sayanriju/jikascript.git
cd jikascript
```

### Option B: create your own repo from the template (with GitHub CLI)

If you have `gh` installed, you can start from the template and clone your new
repo in one step:

```bash
gh repo create my-jikascript-project \
  --template sayanriju/jikascript \
  --public \
  --clone
cd my-jikascript-project
```

Use `--private` instead of `--public` if you want a private repository.

---

## 2. Install Go

Install Go 1.22 or newer.

```bash
go version
```

If the command prints a version, you're ready to build the CLI.

---

## 3. Install `just` (recommended)

The project includes a friendly [`justfile`](../justfile) with common setup and build commands.

Install `just` with your platform's package manager, or follow the official install instructions:

```bash
just --version
```

If `just` is not installed yet, install it before continuing.

---

## 4. Install PlatformIO

JikaScript targets CH32V003 firmware through [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
PlatformIO downloads the CH32V platform, the `ch32v003fun` framework, and the
RISC-V toolchain on first build, so you do not need a separate CH32fun checkout
or a manually installed toolchain.

Install PlatformIO Core:

```bash
pip install platformio
```

Or install the PlatformIO IDE extension for VS Code, which bundles the same
Core.

Verify it is available on your `PATH`:

```bash
pio --version
```

---

## 5. Build the CLI

From your cloned/template project root, build the project-local binary into the repo's `bin/` directory:

```bash
go build -o bin/jikascript ./cmd/jikascript
```

Then run it directly:

```bash
./bin/jikascript version
```

It reports the compiler version and the language specification it targets, for
example JikaScript `0.3.1` and language spec `0.2.0`.

Or install it to your Go `PATH` and use the command name directly:

```bash
go install ./cmd/jikascript
jikascript version
```

Or use the repo shortcuts:

```bash
just install
just check --file=examples/blink.jika
just transpile --file=examples/blink.jika
just build --source=examples/blink.jika
just build-c --source=out/blink.c
just flash --source=examples/blink.jika
```

Common helper recipes:

```bash
just clean          # remove generated build output (build/, out/)
just erase          # erase the connected CH32 flash
just unbrick        # recovery flow: erase then reflash the device
```

Recipe parameters are **flags, not positional arguments**. Pass them with
`--name=value`; the positional form (`just build examples/blink.jika`) fails
with `justfile does not contain recipe`. Run `just --list` to see the available
options for each recipe.

---

## 6. Your first check

Try the checker:

```bash
jikascript check examples/blink.jika
```

Then transpile:

```bash
jikascript transpile examples/blink.jika --output=out/blink.c
```

If that works, you're ready to move on to the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) and build your first embedded program.

---

## Build firmware

Build a CH32V003 firmware image with a single command:

```bash
jikascript build examples/blink.jika
```

This generates a PlatformIO project under `out/blink-pio/`, runs `pio run`, and
copies the result to `build/blink.elf` and `build/blink.bin`.

To build and upload in one step:

```bash
jikascript flash examples/blink.jika
```

Add `--optimize=speed` to trade flash size for execution speed; see
[Optimization](../README.md#optimization) for the full table. Omitting the flag
keeps PlatformIO's default `-Os`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `PlatformIO (pio) not found on PATH`

PlatformIO is not installed, or its executable is not on your `PATH`. Install it
with `pip install platformio` and confirm `pio --version` works in a new shell.

If `pio` lives somewhere unusual, point JikaScript at it directly with the
`JIKASCRIPT_PIO` environment variable instead of changing your `PATH`:

```bash
export JIKASCRIPT_PIO=/opt/homebrew/bin/pio
```

JikaScript reports a distinct error when `JIKASCRIPT_PIO` is set but the path is
missing or not executable, so a typo is easy to spot.

### `unsupported board "..."`

The `--board` value is not one of the supported CH32V003 selectors. Run
`jikascript build` with no `--board` to use the default, or pick one of the
values listed in the [README](../README.md#board-and-environment-selection).

### `just` is not found

Install `just` first, then retry the helper commands.

### You want to inspect generated C before flashing

That's the recommended beginner workflow:

```bash
jikascript transpile examples/blink.jika --output=out/blink.c
# inspect and edit out/blink.c if needed
jikascript build out/blink.c --board=ch32v003 --optimize=size
```

This is the easiest way to review the generated C before producing firmware.
