# GPIO & Hardware

Controlling physical pins in JikaScript is as simple as calling methods on an object.

```javascript
const led = pin("PC1");
const button = pin("PD2");

led.output();
button.input();

led.write(HIGH);
let pressed = button.read() == LOW;
```

## Binding a Pin

`pin()` binds a hardware pin to a variable. The argument must be a **string
literal** naming a pin the target supports — the compiler rejects variables,
expressions, and unknown pin names.

```javascript
const led = pin("PC1");
```

Names are case-insensitive and whitespace-trimmed, so `pin("pc1")` and
`pin(" PC1 ")` both resolve to `PC1`.

**Available pins on CH32V003:** `PA1`, `PA2`, `PC0`–`PC7`, `PD0`–`PD7`.

Because the name is known at compile time, `pin("PC1")` becomes the constant
`JIKA_PIN_PC1` in the generated C. There is no runtime string lookup and no
pin-name switch in the firmware.

## Pin Methods

A pin object supports exactly these five methods. Any other method name is a
compile error.

| Method | Arguments | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.output()` | none | — | Configure the pin as a push-pull output. |
| `.input()` | none | — | Configure the pin as a floating input. |
| `.write(value)` | optional | — | Drive an output pin to `HIGH` or `LOW`. |
| `.read()` | none | `int` | Read the pin level: `1` for high, `0` for low. |
| `.toggle()` | none | — | Invert the current output level. |

`write()` accepts any value: non-zero drives the pin high, zero drives it low.
Calling `write()` with no argument writes `LOW`.

Passing arguments to any other method is a compile error.

## Pin State Constants

`HIGH` and `LOW` are compiler-provided constants with the fixed meanings
`HIGH == 1` and `LOW == 0`. They are not ordinary variables — you cannot
reassign or shadow them. If you want a named alias, create a separate binding
such as `const ledOn = HIGH`.

## Example: Button-Controlled LED

Poll a push-button every 20 ms and drive an LED to match its state:

```javascript
const led = pin("PC1");
const button = pin("PD2");

led.output();
button.input();

task("button_check", 20, () => {
    if (button.read() == LOW) {
        led.write(HIGH);
    } else {
        led.write(LOW);
    }
});

scheduler.start();
```

Everything compiles down to direct register writes through the CH32fun backend —
fast, efficient, and direct.
